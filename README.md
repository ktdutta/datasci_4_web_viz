### Shiny R 

While using shiny R I ran into many errors in terms of running the application which I will be setting up a meeting with the professor in order to better understand what is going wrong. In terms of the code portion, there were no errors and all the necessary packages were downloaded in order to run the application. The problem I was running into was that although I sucessfully installed shiny, the shiny command was not being found. I looked this up online as many others have ran across this problem, however regardless of re-installing the package usingvarious methods the command still did not work, making me think there must be an issue with the version being downloaded. In terms of a coding difference I noticed, was defining the raw dataset url as 'url' which made it easier to download the the dataset this time around.

### Python's Shiny 
While using Python to vizualize the application that I wanted to create using Shiny R, I had a better experience. The dropdown bar graph created to visualize the MA dataset I was working with was very developer-friendly from the back end. In terms of it being user friendly from the front-end there really isnt an oopurtunity for front-end users to utilize this interactive method of understanding the dataset unless they copy the code and run it themselves. Overall I had a good experience and enjoyed visualizing my dataset using this method. 

### Flask 
I enjoyed developing the application for this method, however I did run into problems while deploying the application. With the code written the application was functioning just how I wanted and contained all the data which I included within the python shiny visualization. However, when I tried to access the link to the website post deployment, it took me to a screen where is stated that the application is running, however I must deploy the code in order to see the website. I continued to deploy code multiple times and check the resource group in order to check if the application was completelly deployed and running. Even though it stated that the application was properly deployed in the resource group I continued to face the same problem. After making for changes, I was unfortunately unable to open up the application. In order to fix this problem I will be redoing this portion from scratch and will be creating a new resource group to hopefully see better results.
